#Gymbilletter
##Translates to "highscool tickets", it's a service for party tickets for my school.
The website https://gymbilletter.dk/ is bad from a technical standpoint.

This is the usual [RIIR](https://transitiontech.ca/random/RIIR) even though it's not really necessary.
This project is mostly about learning how to use rocket, diesel, templates, postgres and how to use them together.

TODO:

 - [ ] Add an admin request guard
 - [ ] Get some good templates going
